The grid is finite,\nand no life can exist off the edges. When calculating\nthe next generation of the grid, follow these four rules:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours\n   dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours\n   dies, as if by overcrowding.\n3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours\n   lives on to the next generation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours\n   becomes a live cell.\n\nExamples: * indicates live cell, . indicates dead cell\n\nExample input: (4 x 8 grid)\n4 8\n........\n....*...\n...**...\n........\n\nExample output:\n4 8\n........\n...**...\n...**...\n........\n"},"exercise":"Game_of_Life"}
