If the highest\ncards have the same value, the hands are ranked by the next\nhighest, and so on.\n\nPair: 2 of the 5 cards in the hand have the same value. \nHands which both contain a pair are ranked by the value of\nthe cards forming the pair. If these values are the same, \nthe hands are ranked by the values of the cards not \nforming the pair, in decreasing order.\n\nTwo Pairs: The hand contains 2 different pairs. Hands \nwhich both contain 2 pairs are ranked by the value of \ntheir highest pair. Hands with the same highest pair \nare ranked by the value of their other pair. If these \nvalues are the same the hands are ranked by the value \nof the remaining card.\n\nThree of a Kind: Three of the cards in the hand have the \nsame value. Hands which both contain three of a kind are \nranked by the value of the 3 cards.\n\nStraight: Hand contains 5 cards with consecutive values. \nHands which both contain a straight are ranked by their \nhighest card.\n\nFlush: Hand contains 5 cards of the same suit.
